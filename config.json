      "Hi! I'm Varun Rathod, a Computer Science undergraduate at PES University passionate about building technology from the ground up — and securing it. I work across the full spectrum: systems programming, full-stack development, mobile apps, and applied machine learning.",
      "I've built secure VoIP systems with raw sockets, developed Linux kernel modules, created full-stack platforms (PESUbytes), mobile apps in Flutter (Leetingo), and trained many ML models too. Currently expanding into cybersecurity and security-focused AI — exploring threat detection, anomaly analysis, and secure automation through CTFs and hands-on projects.",
      "I value continuous learning, clean and secure engineering, and ethical innovation. Always open to connecting with people in tech, research, and security communities!"
